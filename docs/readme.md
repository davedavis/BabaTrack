# BabaTrack
BabaTrack is an Android app that lets you choose from a selection of pink, white, nature and weather sounds and track which your baby responds to best or which combination helps your baby sleep best.



# Info
This app is what I am working on for the Udacity Android Nanodegree program. Some helper methods and image resources were used from that course.

# Features
Play various White/Pink/Brown noises to help your baby sleep.


# ToDo
- Add favourites feature and toggle to easily see what sounds your baby responds to.
- Add better AudioManager integration to allow multiple streams.
- Add ability to download and store higher fidelity sounds.
- Implement fragments into navigation.
- Add volume slider to sounds for mixing.
- Remove MediaPlayer release methods when sounds start.
- Remove debug logging.
